# 🎧 AudioInsight

**AudioInsight** is a Python-based side project that leverages OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe lyrics from an audio file and then searches Google to identify the song. It combines state-of-the-art speech recognition with web scraping to provide insight into what you're listening to.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ Transcribes audio files using the Whisper ASR model
- 🔍 Automatically searches Google for the likely song based on transcribed lyrics
- 📄 Displays song information scraped from search results
- 🔧 Easy to run locally with minimal setup

---

## 🛠️ Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install openai-whisper
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
````

## 📁 File Structure

```
AudioInsight/
├── audio_insight.py    # Main script to transcribe and search
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Loads the Whisper ASR model.
2. Transcribes the input audio file (`.mp3`, `.wav`, etc.).
3. Uses the transcribed lyrics to perform a Google search.
4. Scrapes and prints relevant song identification results.

---

## 💻 Usage

Update the path to your audio file in the script:

```python
result = model.transcribe(r"C:\Path\To\Your\AudioFile.mp3")
```

Then run the script:

```bash
python audio_insight.py
```
